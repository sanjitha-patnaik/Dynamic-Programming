# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) 

## Problem Statement:
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence common to both sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same order but not necessarily contiguous.


# Typical Implementation:
The Longest Common Subsequence problem is typically implemented using dynamic programming. The dynamic programming table is filled using a bottom-up approach (tabulation) to efficiently calculate the length of the LCS. The solution is then reconstructed from the filled table.



# Applications:

DNA Sequencing:
In bioinformatics, LCS is used to identify common patterns in DNA sequences, aiding in genetic research.

Version Control Systems:
LCS is employed in version control systems (e.g., Git) to identify the differences between different versions of files.

Text Comparison:
Used in plagiarism detection tools and textual similarity analysis.

Speech Recognition:
In speech recognition systems, LCS helps identify and match similar phonemes in spoken words.

Spell Checking:
LCS is used in spell-checking algorithms to suggest corrections by identifying common subsequences between misspelled and correctly spelled words.



# Time Complexity:
Let m and n be the lengths of the two input sequences. The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution for the LCS problem is O(m⋅n). This is because, for each pair of characters in the sequences, a constant amount of work is done.



# Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(m⋅n) as we use a 2D array (dp) of size (m+1)×(n+1) to store the length of the LCS for each pair of substrings.
