# Traveling Salesman Problem
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. 


# Typical Implementation:

## Dynamic Programming Table:
The TSP problem is often solved using dynamic programming, and the solution involves building a table to store optimal subproblems.

## Bitmasking:
Bitmasking is frequently used to represent subsets of cities efficiently.

## Held-Karp Algorithm:
The Held-Karp algorithm is a common approach for solving TSP using dynamic programming. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost of visiting each city exactly once.



# Applications:

Logistics and Routing:
Used in optimizing delivery routes for logistics companies to minimize travel distances.

Manufacturing:
Applied in manufacturing to optimize the order of operations on a production line.

Network Design:
Used in designing efficient communication networks where cities represent nodes and distances represent communication costs.

Circuit Board Manufacturing:
In electronic engineering, TSP is used to optimize the order of drilling holes in a circuit board.

Vehicle Routing:
Applied in planning routes for vehicles like taxis, buses, or garbage trucks to minimize fuel consumption and travel time.



# Time Complexity:
The Held-Karp algorithm, a dynamic programming solution for TSP, has a time complexity of O(n^2 . 2^n) where n is the number of cities. This complexity arises from iterating over subsets of cities and updating the dynamic programming table.



# Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the Held-Karp algorithm is O(nâ‹…2^n) due to the storage of the dynamic programming table.


# Dynamic Programming Approach:

The algorithm builds a dynamic programming table to store the minimum cost of visiting a subset of cities ending in a particular city.
It iterates over all subsets of cities and updates the minimum cost based on the previous subsets.
The final minimum cost is obtained by considering the cost of returning from each city to the starting city.
