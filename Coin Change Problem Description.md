# Coin Change Problem:

## Problem Statement:
Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, the Coin Change Problem involves finding the number of ways to make the target amount using any combination of coins.

# Typical Implementation:
The Coin Change Problem is typically implemented using dynamic programming, specifically in a bottom-up approach (tabulation). The algorithm iterates through each coin denomination and updates the number of ways for each amount. The memoization approach (top-down) can also be used for a recursive solution with memoization.

## Applications:

Currency Systems:
In real-world currency systems, the Coin Change Problem is analogous to determining the number of ways to make change for a given amount using different coin denominations.

Vending Machines:
Designing algorithms for vending machines to return change efficiently.

Combinatorial Optimization:
The problem appears in combinatorial optimization scenarios where finding the optimal combination of resources or items is crucial.

Dynamic Programming Practice:
It is a classic problem used for practicing and understanding dynamic programming concepts.



# Time Complexity:
Let n be the target amount and m be the number of coin denominations. The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution for the Coin Change Problem is 
O(nâ‹…m). This is because, for each coin denomination, we iterate through each amount from the current coin denomination up to the target.


# Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) as we use a one-dimensional array (dp) of size n+1 to store the number of ways for each amount from 0 to the target.
